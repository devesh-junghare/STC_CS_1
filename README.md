🔐 SCT_CYB_01 - Caesar Cipher Tool

📄 Task Overview:
As part of the SkillCraft Internship, this task was focused on building a basic encryption tool using Python, based on the classic Caesar Cipher method. This cipher works by shifting characters in the alphabet to hide the original message.

✨ Key Highlights:
1)🔁 Ability to encode and decode messages using a user-defined shift value
2)🔠 Works seamlessly with both uppercase and lowercase text
3)💻 Designed with a simple, clear logic — perfect for beginners exploring      cryptography

🧠 Skills Gained:
1.Practical understanding of substitution-based encryption
2.Hands-on use of ASCII manipulation for character shifting
3.Strengthened basics in loops, conditions, and string handling in Python

▶️ How to Execute:
Step 1:- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Step 2:- Navigate to the script directory using a terminal.
Step 3:- Run the script using:

python Caesar_Cipher_Algorithm.py
